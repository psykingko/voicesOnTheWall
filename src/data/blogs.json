In web design, this means:\n\n- Clean layouts with plenty of white space\n- Thoughtful typography\n- Purposeful use of color\n- Clear navigation\n\nWhen done right, minimalist design creates a calm, focused experience that allows your content to shine. It's not about removing everything—it's about removing everything that doesn't serve a purpose.\n\nRemember: less is more, but only when that 'less' is carefully chosen.",
